# mips-processor
## overview
MIPS, which stands for Microprocessor incorporating Pipelined Stages, is a popular Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture known for its streamlined design and efficient performance.
## Features
- 5-Stage Pipeline Architecture:Instruction Fetch (IF), Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory (MEM), Write Back (WB).
- Two-Phase Clocking System: clk1 and clk2 manage alternating pipeline stages to prevent data hazards.
- Instruction Support:R-type: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, SLT, MUL ; I-type: ADDI, SUBI, SLTI ; Memory: LW, SW ; Control: BEQZ, BNEQZ, HLT
